###### Project Summary: Strictly adhere to the object-oriented programming specifications given in the problem statement.
The task is to create a basic School Management System where students can register to courses, and view the course assigned to them.

**Work Flow:**
>Only students with the right credentials can log in. Otherwise, a message is displayed stating: “Wrong Credentials”
>
>Valid students are able to see the courses they are registered.
>
>Valid students are able to register to any course in the system as long as they are NOT already registered.
>
>Handle all possible exceptions and include appropriate commenting. Test at least one of your methods using Junit.



**Notes/Comments:**

>-I originally used Lombok and decided to not use it because of too many overlapping and/or lack of naming conventions while working with given code
>
>-Log in validation works, but would need to work on switch statement for registering courses
>
>-I followed the template requirements from 1-4 to its exactness, but once I got to the main entry for requirement 5, I found it tricky to modify and work with the given SMSRunner
>
>-Weekends are not ideal for me for these kinds of assignments since I work. If this were given earlier in the weekday I think I would have done better since I've dedicated Monday
through Friday soley for this course. On weekends I only have very early mornings and very late nights availble to work on this assignment (if I cut out some sleep)
